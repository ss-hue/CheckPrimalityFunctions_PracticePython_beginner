#          * Comments *
#----------------------------------

# Ask the user to type a number
# Create variable b, an empty list with the size of the number the user typed in.

# Conditional to check if the input number is not '0'(zero). In case it is, we return (or print) a message showing that '0' is not prime. End of program.

# In any other case, we enter into the For Loop that uses range (1, a), in order to check 
# if the user's number can be divided by any of those numbers between 1 and user's number - 1. 
# This checking process is made by the conditional operator inside the loop.

# 'count' variable will increment itself whenever there's a divisor within the interval between 1 and user's number - 1

# 'b.append(i)' will store all the numbers that fall under the conditional operator. 
# This can be useful in order to let the user know which numbers are the divisors. This is just bonus information.

# The return statement inside the loop is build up as a ternary operator in order to save lines of code.
# Its meaning is to check if the total sum of variable 'count' is greater than 1, i.e, if more than 1 divisor was collected or confirmed. 
# This will give us a hint that the given number can't be a prime number.

#           *Examples*
#----------------------------------

# Enter your number here: 4
# 'Your number, 4, is not a prime number. These are its divisors [1, 2]'

# Enter your number here: 5
# 'Your number, 5, is a prime number'
